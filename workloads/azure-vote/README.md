 ## Azure Voting App
 The application [Azure Voting App](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis/) is used for this deployment as this application is quite simple, but yet demonstrates how to deploy an application composed of multiple containers. In this case the application is composed of a web-front-end written in Python and a data backend running Redis.
